## Hi there 👋

### 🚀 About Me 
🤠 My name is Andrew Kicklighter, a Software Engineer based out of the Twin Cities in Minnesota. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Iowa State in May of 2020 with a degree in Computer Engineering. 

🔭 I enjoy working on a few personal projects in my free time, Currently, I’m developing a multi-platform project for a server I’m in. It includes a Kotlin-based Discord bot (using the [Kord](https://github.com/kordlib/kord?tab=readme-ov-file) library), a Spring Boot backend, and a React website for game management and stat viewing. The project is a football game where players guess numbers that determine play outcomes. A MariaDB database supports the game, and everything is hosted on a Linux VPS with Jenkins pipelines managing deployments.

🏃 Outside of coding I have a lot of exciting hobbies and skills. I've run 3 marathons and counting and have been running since middle school and am shooting to qualify for the Boston Marathon within the next 5 years. I enjoy backpacking and camping, I spent 4 summers in New Mexico at Philmont Scout Ranch leading backpacking treks. I also am an avid aviation enthusiast and plan on getting my private pilots license in the future, but for now spend a lot of my time flying on flight simulators at home. On top of that, I also enjoy car racing and also do a lot of sim racing as well. If I'm not doing any of the above, there's a good chance I'm watching sports!

✈️ I also love to travel and explore, my wife and I spend a lot of time exploring various corners of Minnesota, as well as the world. We plan on travelling this year to Germany.

⚡ A fun fact about me is I'm a dual citizen of Luxembourg 🇱🇺 and the United States 🇺🇸. While I was born in the US and have lived here my entire life, I have my Luxembourg citizenship through ancestry!
