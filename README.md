## Hi there 👋

### 🚀 About Me 
🤠 My name is Andrew Kicklighter, a Software Engineer based out of the Twin Cities in Minnesota. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Iowa State in May of 2020 with a degree in Computer Engineering. 

🔭 I enjoy working on a few personal projects in my free time, the main project I've been currently working on is a Discord bot/Spring Boot service/website for a server I'm in. This project is creating a number based football game that the server competes in. The gist of the game is you guess a number between 1-1500, as does your opponent. The difference in numbers determines the result of the football play. The closer the number, the better the outcome for the offense and vice versa. This project is written in Kotlin for the Discord service and uses the [Kord Discord Library](https://github.com/kordlib/kord?tab=readme-ov-file), Kotlin Spring Boot for the backend service, and React for the website. The database is a MariaDB database and everything is hosted on a Linux virtual private server, with deploys being done through Jenkins pipelines.

🏃 Outside of coding I have a lot of exciting hobbies and skills. I've run 3 marathons and counting and have been running since middle school and am shooting to qualify for the Boston Marathon within the next 5 years. I enjoy backpacking and camping, I spent 4 summers in New Mexico at Philmont Scout Ranch leading backpacking treks. I also am an avid aviation enthusiast and plan on getting my private pilots license in the future, but for now spend a lot of my time flying on flight simulators at home. On top of that, I also enjoy car racing and also do a lot of sim racing as well. If I'm not doing any of the above, there's a good chance I'm watching sports!

✈️ I also love to travel and explore, my wife and I spend a lot of time exploring various corners of Minnesota, as well as the world. We plan on travelling this year to Germany.

⚡ A fun fact about me is I'm a dual citizen of Luxembourg 🇱🇺 and the United States 🇺🇸. While I was born in the US and have lived here my entire life, I have my Luxembourg citizenship through ancestry!
