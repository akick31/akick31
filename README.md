# Andrew Kicklighter | Senior Software Engineer
**Full Stack Engineer | Distributed Systems | High-Scale Backend Architecture**

I am a Senior Software Engineer based in the Twin Cities, MN, with a focus on building high-availability systems and scalable full-stack applications. My experience ranges from maintaining algorithms handling **40M+ daily transactions** to architecting end-to-end platforms from the ground up.

### Featured Projects

#### 1. Sine: Procedural Logic iOS Game
*A high-performance, 60fps mobile application logic game to match oscilloscope waveforms, built to explore high-velocity application development.*

**The Tech Stack**
* **Framework:** Flutter / Dart (Reactive UI & Canvas API)
* **Development Workflow:** AI-Assisted Engineering (Cursor)
* **Platform:** iOS (Native Performance Optimization)
* **Logic Engine:** Custom procedural waveform generation algorithms

**Key Achievement**
* Developed and shipped a polished product from scratch in **4 weeks**, leveraging AI-assisted workflows to compress a traditional 4-month development cycle.
* Optimized rendering logic to maintain a consistent **60fps** during complex procedural animations and real-time user waveform manipulation.
* Engineered a mathematical matching system that evaluates user-generated waveforms against target patterns in real-time.


#### 2. College Football Simulation Platform
*A full-stack, event-driven gaming ecosystem built to handle complex procedural logic and real-time user interactions.*

**The Tech Stack**
* **Backend:** Kotlin / Spring Boot (REST API, Football Game Logic)
* **Frontend:** React (Website for Management Dashboard & Statistics)
* **Real-time Interface:** Discord Bot (Kord library) for live game execution
* **Database & Infrastructure:** MariaDB, Linux VPS, Nginx, Jenkins CI/CD Pipelines

**Key Achievement**
* Architected a **centralized Spring Boot engine** to manage state across both a website and a real-time Discord interface.
* Implemented automated **CI/CD pipelines via Jenkins** for seamless deployment to a Linux environment and using Nginx to host the website.
* Developed custom procedural logic to translate numerical inputs into dynamic game outcomes in real-time.

### Beyond the Code
When I'm not architecting systems, I'm likely training for my next marathon (5 and counting!), backpacking, or exploring the world with my wife.
