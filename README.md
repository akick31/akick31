### About Me 
My name is Andrew Kicklighter, a Software Engineer based out of the Twin Cities in Minnesota. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Iowa State in May of 2020 with a degree in Computer Engineering. 

I enjoy working on a few personal projects in my free time, Currently, I’m developing a multi-platform project for a server I’m in. It includes a Kotlin-based Discord bot (using the [Kord](https://github.com/kordlib/kord?tab=readme-ov-file) library), a Spring Boot backend, and a React website for game management and stat viewing. The project is a football game where players guess numbers that determine play outcomes. A MariaDB database supports the game, and everything is hosted on a Linux VPS with Jenkins pipelines managing deployments.

Outside of coding, I enjoy running (3 marathons and counting), backpacking, gardening, aviation (and flight simulators), video games, and sim racing. If I'm not doing any of those, there's a good chance I'm watching sports! My wife and I love to travel and explore the world as well.
