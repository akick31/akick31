* **Key Achievement:** Developed and shipped from scratch in **4 weeks**, maintaining a consistent 60fps rendering speed for complex procedural animations.
* **Focus:** UI/UX Performance, Procedural Content Generation, Rapid Prototyping.

#### College Football Simulation Platform
*A full-stack, event-driven gaming ecosystem built to handle complex procedural logic and real-time user interactions.*

**The Tech Stack:**
* **Backend:** Kotlin / Spring Boot (REST API, Procedural Game Logic)
* **Frontend:** React (Website for Management Dashboard & Statistics)
* **Real-time Interface:** Discord Bot (Kord library) for live game execution
* **Database & Infrastructure:** MariaDB, Linux VPS, Nginx, Jenkins CI/CD Pipelines

**Key Engineering Challenges Solved:**
* Architected a **centralized Spring Boot engine** to manage state across both a website and a real-time Discord interface.
* Implemented automated **CI/CD pipelines via Jenkins** for seamless deployment to a Linux environment and using Nginx to host the website.
* Developed custom procedural logic to translate numerical inputs into dynamic game outcomes in real-time.

### Beyond the Code
When I'm not architecting systems, I'm likely training for my next marathon (5 and counting!), backpacking, or exploring the world with my wife.
